        <p>There is a preconceived notion that attractive women cannot be smart. Models are often excellent businesswomen and know very well how to manage a long and profitable career, becoming TV show presenters or video fitness instructors to help people keep fit, launching beauty lines or fragrances, or starting an acting career. And many of them get involved in charity programs. For a career that can very easily be short-lived, a good model is one that recognizes and accepts how ever-changing the industry is, and has the flexibility to adapt to it. Read below to learn about two of the most successful models in 2022.</p>
