            <p>What makes a fashion designer stand out in this competitive industry? Here's what top designers have to say:</p>
            <p>"What I've always disliked about fashion is trends. When you know who you are, you don't need to change faces every morning."</p> 
            <p>—Marine Serre;</p> 
            <p>[The pandemic] is giving more time to designers to experience new ways of showing clothes and expressing different styles. More and more, I feel like there's not one trend but different ways of approaching fashion. The more diverse it is, the more interesting it is for me."</p> 
            <p>—Isabel Marant;</p>
            <p>"It's the radical act of having the strength to be who you are; that's what I mean by romanticism today. It's a subjective, almost anarchic gesture, assertive of one's own identity—exactly like punk."</p> 
            <p>—Pierpaolo Piccioli, Valentino.</p>
            <p>Read below to hear about how two up-and-coming designers are changing the industry in 2022.</p>

            Ahluwalia is a menswear brand founded by London-born designer Priya Ahluwalia. Ahluwalia is a 2018 graduate from the MA Menswear course at the University of Westminster, and she won the H&M Design Award in 2019.
            Ahluwalia takes elements from her dual Indian-Nigerian heritage and London roots, exploring the life of secondhand and deadstock clothing using textile techniques to give them new life.
            Ahluwalia was one of the eight joint winners of the 2020 LMVH prize. In February 2021, Ahluwalia won the Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design, and in April, collaborated with Ganni on a womenswear collection.

            <p>The 31 year-old, German-born, Milan-based Del Core honed his considerable sartorial chops at Gucci, where, under Alessandro Michele's tutelage, he was in charge of the VIP department. 
            Björk is one of the many stars he has dressed, which explains why the biomorphic masks covering the model's faces made you immediately think of her—or of some of Alexander McQueen's most savagely beautiful designs. 
            More precisely, they recalled the spectacular 3D Vespers death masks created through generative algorithm-based design by scientist Neri Oxman and her Mediated Matter Group at MIT. 
            That's not the usual association one makes while looking at models strutting on a catwalk.</p>
